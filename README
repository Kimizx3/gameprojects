Warehouse Design

Making a warehouse in a horror atmosphere is challenging because the warehouse is naturally designed with a different ratio than other architecture. When designing the initial greybox of our warehouse, the first thing we thought about was the ratio and purpose of the warehouse.
References and explanations we've been searching for are too general to make the player feel 'isolated and scared.'

The grey box level we came up.
Binary path and 'embedded' path.

From the player's eye level. The ratio and purpose of shelves and items are too vague and distracting.
We wanted our warehouse to be 'completely dark' for players, so we decided to shut off all the lights, and the only light source for players was a flashlight.
The result turned out to be unsatisfactory because of the reason we misused lighting and shelves to get players involved in the environment. The environment is substitutive, and the setting is too easy to be copied.
For the next designs, try to cope with the environmental storytelling with more detailed interactions between the players.
